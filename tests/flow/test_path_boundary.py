"""Regression tests for InterpolationPath endpoint numerics.

Issue #122 (cross-repo cluster with aether-3d #135): velocity<->score and
velocity<->noise conversions divided by ``var`` and computed ``ratio =
a/da`` with no eps floor, producing NaN/Inf at the path endpoints
t in {0, 1} for all three path families.

EPS_BOUNDARY (1e-6) and the sign-preserving ``_safe_floor`` clamp shape
are mirrored in aether-3d #135 — see PR body cross-link.
